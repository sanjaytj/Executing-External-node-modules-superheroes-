# Executing-External-node-modules-superheroes-
We use this (one of them) as externally installing them and starting to explore node Js: https://www.npmjs.com/package/supervillains

We will have to install nodeJs from https://nodejs.org/en/ LTS version preferred

and npm could use: 'install npm' command from cmd

And we should head over to https://npmjs.is website to search for External Node modules 
here we have used https://www.npmjs.com/package/supervillains and that with superheroes and install them via cmd and execute the file using 'node index.js'
